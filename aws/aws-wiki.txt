== your personal JHS server machine in the cloud ==

* always available
* fixed ip address 
* 16 GIB storage
* JHS - ready for you from any hardware anywhere withinternet
* less than $10/month!
* costs are under your control - increase for a bigger machine and easily cancelled

== steps are for Amazon Web Services (aws) from a unix desktop
Could easily be adjusted for any similar cloud service. Unix build scripts need to be reworked to allow build from Windows.

== costs
A small machine (t2.micro - 1 core, 2 GiB ram, 16 GiB storage) with a fixed IP that ran all the time would cost less than $10/month.

This could be significantly reduced with additional inconvenience (no fixed IP) and more management overhead (starting and terminating the instance).

The t2.micro can be easily upgraded. For example, a t4g.medium (2 cores, 4 GiB ram, 16 GiB storage) for $25/mo.

Your first year with t2.micro wiht a new account is free.

== with luck and care you could be running on JHS server (aws instance) within an hour

== aws console navigation
The aws web pages are complicated and are much easier on a larger screen. There can be a response lag and the console is not always updated. If you don't see what you expect, press the refresh button (circular arrow).

In the following:
abc:      - fill in text box
>abc      - click checkbox/button/link
>>abc>def - click abc dropdown and select item

== create an account (only required once)
browse: aws.amazon.com
>Sign in to the Console (upper right corner)
>Create a new AWS account
follow the steps to get your root account and password

== create things required by an instance (only required once or for changes)
browse: aws.amazon.com
>Sign in to the Console
Root user email address:
Password:
>Sign in
Search: ec2 dashboard (enter)

An aws instance requires a few things that can be created in advance.
 Key pair       - ssh security credentials - ssh management of the instance
 Security Group - firewall info for your instance
 Elastic IP     - a fixed IP address that makes it easier to work with the instance

Choose a base name that you will use for your creations. For example: jhs1

Create key pair (EC2 dashboard)
 >Key pairs
 >Create key pair (orange - upper right corner)
 name: jhs1
 >Create key pair (page lower right)
 >download-save file-OK
 move the downloaded jhs1.pem file to your ~/.ssh folder

Create Security group (EC2 dashboard)
 >Security groups
 >Create Security group
 Security group name: jhs1
 Description: ssh 22 jhs 65101
 Inbound rules
 >Add rule
  >>Type>>SSH (will set port 22)
  >>Source>Anywhere-IPv4
 >Add rule
  >>Type>Custom TCP
  Port range: 65101 (this is the JHS server port)
  >>Source>Anywhere-IPv4
 >Create security group (page lower right corner)

Create Elastic IP (EC2 dashboard)
 >Elastic IPs
 >Allocate Elastic IP address
 >Amazon's pool of IPv4 addresses
 >Allocate (page lower right)
 Name: jhs1

copy Allocated IPv4 address (form a.b.c.d - e.g. 54.88.234.170) to clipboard

unix terminal:
$ cd path-to-ide/jhs/aws-folder # e.g. j9.4/addons/ide/jhs/aws
$ ./aws.sh set paste-eip-here   # write eip to file

== Launch an instance (EC2 dashboard)

 >Launch Instance (orange)

Associate elastic ip with the instance (EC2 dashboard)
 >Elastic IPs
 >mark checkbox of Elastic IP you want to use
 >>Actions>Associate Elastic IP address
 >>Instance>select your jhs1 instance
 >Associate

== Configure the instance by loading software and running JHS
From a unix terminal window:
$ cd j9.4/addons/ide/jhs/aws # path to addon ide/jhs
$ ./aws.sh set a.b.c.d       # necessary when elastic ip is created
$ ./aws.sh clr               # necessary with new instance to avoid known host error
$ ./aws.sh bld hownow        # necessary with new instance to build system and start JHS https with logon key
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
