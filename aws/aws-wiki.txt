=== J cloud server ===

* J (JHS) - ready for you from any hardware anywhere
* always available
* fixed IP address 
* less than $10/month!
* easy to control costs and cancel
* you could be on your JHS server in an hour

A small machine (t2.micro - 1 core, 2 GiB ram, 8 GiB storage) with fixed IP that ran all the time would cost less than $10/month. The t2.micro can be easily upgraded. For example, a t4g.medium (2 cores, 4 GiB ram, 16 GiB storage) for $25/mo.

Costs significantly reduced with some inconvenience (no fixed IP and managed instant start/terminate).

Your first year on t2.micro with a new account is free!

These steps are for Amazon Web Services (aws) from a unix desktop/laptop. Easily adjusted for any similar cloud service. Unix scripts need to be reworked for windows.

=== aws console navigation ===
The aws web pages are complex and are easier on a larger screen. There can be a response lag and the console is not always updated. If you don't see what you expect, press a refresh button (circular arrow).

Notation:
->url     - browse url    
*         - open section - click right triangle to get down expansion
abc%...   - fill in text box and press enter
>abc      - click button/link/checkbox
>>abc>def - click abc dropdown and select item
#...      - comment
$...      - unix terminal command

=== create things an instance requires (once only or for changes) ===
An instance requires 3 things:
 Key pair       - ssh security credentials
 Security group - firewall info
 Elastic IP     - fixed IP address - easier to work with the instance

=== configure instance - install software and run JHS ===
 $ cd j9.4/addons/ide/jhs/aws/aws # path to aws - adjust as necessary
 $ ./aws.sh clr           # required for new instance - avoid known host error
 $ ./aws.sh bld logon-key # required for new instance - build and start JHS
 #  Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes

=== connect to your instance ===
