J script files (xxx.ijs) contain J code
)

fin=: '~addons/ide/jhs/spx/overview_example.ijs'
jpath fin  NB. ~addons expands to J addons folder
data=: fread fin NB. file read

data fwrite fout NB. data written to file
load fout  NB. load script to define crsum
mat=: ?3 4$10 NB. random numbers from 3 by 4 matrix of 10s
mat
crsum mat NB. crsum adds row and col sums

crsum NB. display defn

name=: ... NB. global assignment
name=. ... NB. local assigment - only for current definition

crsum sentence:
t=. y,+/y
assigns the local name t

what if you asked for a long sleep by mistake or your code had an infinite loop?

you need to signal break to get back control
)

0 : 0
â˜°.break
no effect if nothing is running

if J is running locally: signal break with
 ctrl+c in window that started your server

it takes 2 breaks to break a sleep
 and one to break a loop

next step will sleep for 15 seconds
use â˜°.break twice
 or
ctrl+c twice in your JHS server
to break out of the sleep
) 

0 : 0
enter the following line in the input area:
   jxsleep 15

and then signal 2 breaks with â˜°.break or ctrl+c
