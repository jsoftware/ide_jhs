6 minutes with this lab covers J programming mechanics with the JHS interface

J coding is covered by other labs and resources referenced at the end

lab advance gives J next line from lab file
 keyboard: ctrl+.
 touchscreen: right green button

do a lab advance now

J scripts (file names ending in .ijs) contain J code

fout=: '~temp/ovtour.ijs' NB. J temp folder
data fwrite fout NB. data written to file
load fout  NB. load script to define crsum

the crsum sentence:
t=. y,+/y

browsers appropriate most keyboard shortcuts
JHS uses esc key for some shortcuts
esc is not held down like ctrl/shift/alt/cmd
press and release esc and then press shortcut

for shortcut: esc-1
press/release escape key
then press/release 1 key

next step opens file ovtour.ijs for editing

jterm can run as 'single page application'
an edit page can share the same browser window!

esc-1 switch to jterm
esc-2 switch to the next page

use â˜° on touch screen without esc key

after next step shows edit page
 use esc-1/2 to switch between jterm and edit

what if you asked for a long sleep by mistake or your code had an infinite loop?

you need to signal break to get back control
)

0 : 0
click â˜°
note: break item has shortcut esc-c

esc-c or â˜°.break signals break
no effect if nothing is running

if J is running locally: signal break with
 ctrl+c in window that started your server

it takes 2 breaks to break a sleep
 but only one to break a loop
 
run following sentence in input area:
   jxsleep 10 NB. 2 breaks to end the delay
