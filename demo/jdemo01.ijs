<hr>Pressing rollem button:<br>
calls js function ev_roll_click()<br>
which calls jsubmit()<br>
which calls verb ev_roll_click<br>
which returns a new page<br><br>

The browser sends all form data with the submit request
to the server. The server creates a complete new page and
sends it to the browser. There is little form data in this example
and the page is small so there is not much data sloshing.
But in a real app it could be lots and the app could be sluggish,
especially over a network.
